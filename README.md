# ReinforcementLearning
Project for the RL course 

The home loan market is a multifaceted and ever-changing industry, influenced by a variety of
factors that impact both the supply and demand sides. One interesting area that reinforcement
learning algorithms can provide helpful insight is the decision for approval for different amounts
of loans given individualistic background information. Even though banking sector aims to be
transparent about the requirements as much as possible, both the demand and supply side can still
benefit from a fairer and more transparent decision process given the cost of examination of the
loan application from the supply side and cost of preparation of application from the demand side.
We aim to compare different reinforcement learning algorithms in their maximization of approval
rate given different loan categories. On top of that, we also investigate whether component analysis
techniques of unsupervised machine learning literature can enhance the algorithms or not. More
specifically, we aim to test whether dimensionality reduction changes the results of linear upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithm and to what extend linear UCB and Thompson Sampling (TS)
algorithms are useful in maximizing approval rates.
